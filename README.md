Description of the project:
The project is outliend as follows:

We are aiming to create a financial app that allows one to micromanage their savings. Most people
only have one or two savings accounts, with just a lump sum amount of money, but most people have more than
one thing they are saving for. Our application will make it so that you can further subdivide your
savings in to as many or as little categories and funds as they would like.

They will have custom control on how they would like to allocate money to these funds. For example, for every
contribution to their savings account, they want to allocate 20% to the "New Car Fund". The application does
not move the money, or otherwise do anything with the money, but just breaks down and keeps tracks of 
various uses the user may have for their saved money. These can be limited funds, such as "New Macbook Pro"
limited to $3000, or open ended funds such as "House Downpayment" that keep increasing past their goal amount.

The application would have visuals to aid the user, such as graphs and charts, as well as an easy to use UI.
